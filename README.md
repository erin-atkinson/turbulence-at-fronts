# Turbulence at fronts
A component of my PhD thesis. 

## Simulation
LES (hopefully) simulations of submesoscale mixed layer fronts in the ocean using `Oceananigans.jl`. 
## File setup
### src-fronts
Scripts to create a simulation in Oceananigans. Split into components to make life easier.
### src-analysis
Post-processing scripts and helper functions to generate data to be plotted once simulations are run
### experiments
Shell scripts that run each case.
### analysis
Notebooks used for visualisation, testing and general messing around.

## Science
